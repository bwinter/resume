# Brendan Winter — Résumé

This repository contains the exported versions of my résumé and the image assets I use for LinkedIn feature links. The canonical source document lives in Google Docs; this repo is the published/exported copy.

## Files

- **`Brendan-Winter-Resume.pdf`** — designed/exported version for humans to read.
- **`Brendan-Winter-Resume.md`** — text/ATS-friendly export, easier to diff in GitHub.
- **`assets/`** — CTA / feature-link images used on LinkedIn.

## Source of truth & versions

- The résumé is written and maintained in Google Docs.
