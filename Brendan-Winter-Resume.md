* Cut SQL prototyping, data analysis, and debugging from **days** to **hours** by building a **project-specific GPT** grounded in the team's models, log schema, and datasets.

* Replaced 1/7/14-day usage/conversion rollups with full-history reporting over 10M+ rows while maintaining baseline response times and simplifying maintenance — by reducing joins, centralizing models and adding caching (Athena/Iceberg/CloudFront logs/Metabase).

| Software Reliability Engineer 3, VMware (acquired by Broadcom) | *remote, Jan 2020 — Dec 2023* |
| :---- | ----: |

* Standardized operations visibility across Tanzu, collaborating with **20** microservice teams to define **SLIs** & **error budgets**, producing a single-pane dashboard with \~200 charts and \~**60 SLIs**.

* Productize dashboard approach with dashboards-as-code (**Terraform**) — authoring 6 reusable modules, maintaining the Wavefront Terraform provider and **Go** client to simplify configuration and share logic.

* Provided Tanzu Mission Control continuous monitoring against its **99.99% SLO** by building and operating **Kubernetes** clusters running custom SLI probes/controllers that emitted metrics to Wavefront (**time-series DB**). (Kustomize/GitOps, Vault, Python and kubebuilder)

* Drove cross-service **incident triage** for Tanzu microservice teams, resolving a dozen "no-owner" incidents by leading RCAs and handing off results to service teams and their leadership.

* Led Pivotal Web Services' sunset — offboarding **hundreds of thousands of users** and reducing run-rate by \~$1M/month — by planning cutovers/comms and sequencing cohort removals (Rails/AWS/Cloud Foundry).

| Senior Software Engineer, Pivotal (acquired by VMware) | *in-office, Feb 2018 — Jan 2020* |
| :---- | ----: |

* Maintained full-stack Billing & Account Management app and its CI/CD — **pair programming** full time to support hundreds of thousands of users' billing needs — through Rails feature development, migrations and **CI/CD** hardening.

* Maintained the platform's Ruby-based Usage service and its **CI/CD**, across dozens of versions of the platform by shipping features, updating dependencies and fixing customer/CI issues.

* Sustained Pivotal Web Services (PaaS) at a **99.95%** SLO across thousands of nodes and dozens of services while deploying weekly updates — using CI gates, canary node pools, quick rollbacks, dashboards & alerts (Datadog/PagerDuty), leading **incident responses** while updating runbooks and tooling (Bash/Ruby/Python).

* Enhanced team performance for 8 teams by increasing psychological safety (Google's Project Aristotle) by volunteering to moderate team-building exercises based on Spotify's Squad Health Check (SHC).

* Invited to participate in the company's NYC-based SHC knowledge-share, collaborating with other facilitators on processes to improve company-wide practice.

* Gave 6 cohorts of 6–8 new engineers an operations baseline to apply on their microservice teams by facilitating a week-long **onboarding curriculum** built around the PaaS our customers ran.

| Consulting Software Engineer, Textline | *in-office, Jun 2017 — Nov 2017* |
| :---- | ----: |

* Redesigned and rebuilt rigid billing system, enabling dozens of new pricing models by generalizing it into one that was able to bill on arbitrary Ruby objects/usage.

| Senior Software Engineer, Entelo | *in-office, Mar 2017 — Jun 2017* |
| :---- | ----: |

* Built a GitHub API-based worker for data pipeline — improving data freshness/coverage for **hundreds of millions** of candidate profiles using TDD and Ruby.

| Founding Engineer, Gametime | *hybrid, Jun 2013 — Jan 2017* |
| :---- | ----: |

* Supported company growth — from seed ($100K) to Series B ($20M) — as primary architect, capacity planner, and on-call for the first 3 years.

* Enabled early investor demos and customer satisfaction — taking prototype **\<40%** purchase reliability to **≥80%** in the first month — by replacing an alpha Python backend with a robust Ruby implementation.

* Increased checkout reliability to **99%** and reduced incident pages from **5–6/month** down to **fewer than one a month** — by adding idempotency, retries/backoff, adaptive polling, queues (SQS/Kafka), observability (Datadog/Honeybadger) and improving alert hygiene.

* Rightsized backend as users grew from tens of users per day to **tens of thousands** of users per day by implementing Ruby microservices on AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53\) and scaling MongoDB/Redis/Etcd.

* **Onboarded new engineers** — keeping time-to-first-commit within the first couple days — by providing early code reviews and code tours.

* Allowed non-technical teams to add **hundreds** of new venues with **thousands** of seats for multiple teams/performers and vendors by implementing and teaching JSON/regex-based adapter patterns.

* Delivered 8 vendor integrations and cut lead times from **months to days** by standardizing vendor microservice patterns (including Ticket Evolution).

* Grew the engineering team from a single engineer (myself) to 12, participating in hiring ICs, leads and directors.
