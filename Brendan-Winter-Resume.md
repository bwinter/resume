* Authored 6 reusable **dashboards-as-code** **Terraform modules**, maintained Wavefront **Terraform provider** and **Go API client**, simplifying configuration and leveraging modular design.

* Provided Tanzu Mission Control continuous monitoring against its **99.99% SLO** by building and operating **Kubernetes** clusters running custom **SLI probes** and **k8s controllers,** emitting metrics to Wavefront (time-series DB). (Kustomize/GitOps/fluentbit, Vault, **Python** and kubebuilder)

* Drove **cross-service incident triage** for Tanzu microservice teams, resolving a dozen "no-owner" incidents by leading **blameless RCAs** and pushing through organizational friction to get fixes implemented.

* Led Pivotal Web Services' sunset — off-boarding hundreds of thousands of users and reducing run-rate by \~$250k/month — by planning cutovers, comms and cohort removal sequencing (**Rails**/**AWS**/**Cloud Foundry**).

* Maintained full-stack Billing & Account Management app (Rails) and its **CI/CD** — pair programming full time to support hundreds of thousands of users' billing needs — through **Rails** feature development, migrations, CI/CD hardening and on-call (**AWS**/TDD/**runbooks**/**tooling**).

* Maintained Pivotal Web Services (PWS, a **PaaS**) & platform's Rails-based Usage Service and their CI/CD across dozens of versions of the platform, by shipping features, updating dependencies and fixing customer/CI issues.

* Operated PWS at a **99.95% SLO** across thousands of nodes and dozens of services while deploying weekly updates — using CI gates, canary node pools, automated rollbacks, dashboards & alerts (Datadog/PagerDuty), leading **incident responses** while updating **runbooks** and **tooling** (**Bash**/**Ruby**/**Python**).

* Supported a culture of candor and learning for 8 teams by increasing psychological safety (Google's Project Aristotle) by moderating **team-building** exercises that are based on Spotify's Squad Health Check (SHC).

* Invited to participate in the company's NYC-based SHC knowledge-share, collaborating with other facilitators on company-wide SHC improvements.

* Gave 10 cohorts of 6–10 new hires an operations baseline to apply on their microservice teams by facilitating a week-long **onboarding curriculum** built to teach our teams how to run Pivotal's flagship product (PCF).

* Increased checkout **reliability to 99%** and reduced incident pages from **5–6/month** down to **fewer than one a month** — by adding idempotency, retries/backoff, adaptive polling, queues (SQS/Kafka), observability (Datadog/Honeybadger) and improving alert hygiene.

* Rightsized backend as users grew from tens-of users per day to tens-of-thousands by implementing dozens of **Ruby** microservices on **AWS** (EC2, S3, Route 53, etc) and scaling MongoDB/Redis/etcd clusters.

* Onboarded new engineers, improving their success by keeping time-to-first-commit within the first couple days, by providing early code reviews and code tours.

* Allowed non-technical venue-team to add hundreds of new venues, with thousands of seats, for multiple teams, performers and vendors by implementing and teaching basic JSON/regex-based adapter patterns.

* Delivered 8 vendor integrations, cutting lead times from months to days, by standardizing microservice patterns.
